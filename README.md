## Project Description

Provide a more detailed description of your project, its purpose, and any key features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Git** is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- A **GitHub** account and a **new repository** created.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project folder by running:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

3. Initialize the Git repository:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

   This will initialize a new Git repository in your project folder.

### Step 2: Add Files to Git

Once the repository is initialized, you need to add your project files to Git:

```bash
git add .

Step 3: Commit Changes
Now, commit the files you've staged with a message:

bash
Copy
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 4: Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and log in with your credentials.
On the GitHub home page, click on the + icon in the upper-right corner and select New repository.
Choose a repository name and make it public or private, then click Create repository.
Step 5: Add Remote Repository
After creating your GitHub repository, you will be given a URL (remote repository URL). Add the remote repository by running:

bash
Copy
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Step 6: Push to GitHub
Finally, push your local repository to GitHub with:

bash
Copy
git push -u origin master
This will upload your project to your GitHub repository. The -u flag will set the upstream for your master branch, meaning you only need to run git push in the future.

Usage
Once your project is uploaded, you can clone the repository to any other machine with:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Additional Git Commands:
To check the status of your project files:

bash
Copy
git status
To view the commit history:

bash
Copy
git log
Contributing

git commit -m "Description of changes"
Push the changes to your forked repository:

bash
Copy
